## Functionality of the website

The website has a dynamic responsive navbar which can be used to navigate to requested pages. When the "Upload a meme" button is clicked, the website redirects to a form where the user can add his/her name, a caption for the meme and its url and submit. On doing so the meme is added and can be seen on the homepage. Every meme posted shows the number of likes it has by various other users. You can also like any meme you want.
